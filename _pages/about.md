Hello, and welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a Ph.D. student in the INTR thrust at HKUST. My research interest is port optimization, where I explore ways to improve the efficiency and sustainability of container port operations.

I'm thrilled to have you here, and I hope you will find something interesting or useful in the projects I've shared. This page is where I showcase my work, share my thoughts, and connect with the broader community of developers and enthusiasts.

As a software developer and Ph.D. student, I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. On this page, you will find various projects demonstrating my skills and interests, ranging from software development and operations research to reinforcement learning.

But this page isn't just about me. It's also about building connections and fostering community. So if something here resonates with you, if you have questions or feedback, or just want to say hello, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always happy to chat and connect with like-minded individuals.

Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to learn more about me and my work. Feel free to explore the projects, read the blog posts, and connect with me on social media. I'm excited to be part of this vibrant and dynamic community, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Lubin FAN
