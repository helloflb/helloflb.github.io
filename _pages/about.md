Hello, and welcome to my personal webpage!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [INTR thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/systems-hub/intelligent-transportation) at [HKUST(GZ)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interest is port optimization, where I explore ways to improve the efficiency and sustainability of container port operations.

As a software developer and Ph.D. student, I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. On this page, you will find various projects demonstrating my skills and interests, ranging from software development and operations research to reinforcement learning.

But this page isn't just about me. It's also about building connections and fostering community. So if something here resonates with you, if you have questions or feedback, or just want to say hello, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always happy to chat and connect with like-minded individuals.
