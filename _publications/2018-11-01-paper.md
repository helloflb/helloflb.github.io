This paper studies the quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) from two aspects: the task dispatch and quantity configuration of quay cranes. Quay crane task dispatch problem is mainly concerned with the study of handling sequence of quay cranes, while the quay crane configuration problem is used to determine how many quay cranes should be configured to the vessels. Through the analysis of the relationship between the two problems, a coupling model is established. The optimal number of quay cranes and corresponding scheduling scheme can be obtained by solving the coupling model. Compared to the objective and approach of QCSP found in literature, this paper takes the optimal number of quay cranes into account and designs a loop iteration method to solve the coupling model.
